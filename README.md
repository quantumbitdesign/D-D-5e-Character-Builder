# D-D-5e-Character-Builder
This is a React App that makes the character creation process simpler for the role playing game, Dungeons and Dragons, 5th Edition. If you would like to contribute, please toss your ideas at me, and we'll talk about the future of the app.


QUANTUM-WEB-DESIGN- Dungeons and Dragons 5e Character Gen
This is my first app, and its purpose is to simplify the character creation process so that players can jump right into the good stuff without having to spend hours turning through the player's handbook because they forgot one or two things.. or all the things.

QuantumBitDesign Application currently only available through GitHub, but look for it @ quantumbitdesign.com in the near future.

There is nothing to install with this. This web app will work in most if not all web browsers such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, and Safari- especially those that have been properly updated! Hint Hint... It is being designed with accessibility in mind, will be built using a mobile first approach, and will be optimized on the front end for speed using minification, custom picture sizing, and other techniques.
